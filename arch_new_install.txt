Quick tip: Before reinstalling, use pacman to generate package lists. pacman -Qeqn will generate a list of explicitly-installed packages suitable for piping into pacman -S -, then use pacman -Qeqm for a list of every package that isn't in the sync database (e.g. AUR packages). Since we're only listing explicitly-installed packages, install reasons will be preserved, though note that dependencies that are no longer needed will not be restored (use pacman -Qdtq to get a list of those).
